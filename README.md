# 👋 Hi, I’m @AlexandreBaranger

- 👀 I’m interested in sound design and music, focusing on real-time and procedural synthesis using tools like Wwise and Unity. I am a sound artist, not an engineer-developer.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about the cognitive perception of speed and how to implement whoosh controls based on the rotation and speed of objects. My work on rotation can be applied to VR for controlling headset movement and sound.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects involving sound design, procedural audio, and innovative uses of audio in interactive media.
- 📫 How to reach me: baranger.alexandre@orange.fr
- ⚡ Fun fact: I am fascinated by the intersection of audio technology and cognitive science, and I love experimenting with new audio tools and techniques.
