# 👋 Hi, I’m @AlexandreBaranger

- 👀 I’m a sound artist specializing in sound design and music. I focus on real-time and procedural synthesis using tools like Wwise and Unity. I am not an engineer-developer.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about the cognitive perception of speed and how to implement whoosh controls based on the rotation and speed of objects.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects involving sound design, procedural audio, and innovative uses of audio in interactive media.
- 📫 How to reach me: baranger.alexandre@orange.fr
- ⚡ Fun fact: I am fascinated by the intersection of audio technology and cognitive science, and I love experimenting with new audio tools and techniques.
